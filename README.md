A program that reads a .csv file into a variable and adds the different file "values/fields" into the corresponding UFO object's properties. Made this mainly to familiarize myself with file handling/reading.<br/>
Implemented a generic function (ConvertToDateTime) that can effectively return any type of variable by simply returning a custom made object (based on a custom made Class) with different property types.
